## What I learned

The "Coding Bootcamp Testimonials Slider" project provided me with an opportunity to apply and enhance my skills in CSS and JavaScript. By working on this project, I was able to demonstrate my proficiency in creating responsive layouts, implementing smooth transitions, and utilizing JavaScript for interactivity.

In terms of JavaScript, I leveraged its capabilities to handle user interactions and control the slider functionality. Through event listeners, I implemented navigation buttons and keyboard controls, enabling users to easily navigate through the testimonials. I also made use of DOM manipulation to dynamically update the slider's content and transition between slides smoothly.

Throughout the development process, I encountered challenges and successfully found solutions. For example, I effectively managed the timing of slide transitions by carefully coordinating the fade-out and fade-in effects using setTimeout().

By completing this project, I have further strengthened my skills in CSS and JavaScript, gaining hands-on experience in building interactive and dynamic components. It has provided me with valuable insights into creating engaging user experiences and utilizing advanced CSS and JavaScript techniques effectively.

I am proud of the outcome of this project and the opportunity it provided for me to showcase my skills and knowledge in front-end development.
